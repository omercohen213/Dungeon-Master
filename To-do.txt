Fix:
- ability dmg immunity
- 2nd scene load
- enemy movement
- change dmg system (player defense, randomize dmg output)
- potion in ability bar
- change implementation of RecieveDamage
- database instead of json (A solution could be to give id to every item and decode it every login)

ADD:
- ranged weapons (classes)
- attcking pets
- edit 2nd scene
- shop
- item pickup animation
- itemview, questView animation
- log-in, register forms (database)
- save data every 5 min 
- enemy hp bar
